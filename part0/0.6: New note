When a user creates a new note on the single page version of the application,
the following happens
end note

Browser->Server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
Server->Browser: array of notes


note over Browser
Contrary to the initial version, this time,
the post request does not send a URL redirect,
rather it returns an array of notes with the new note included,
and then rerenders the notes/remains on the same page.
This is because the new note is sent over to the server as JSON
by setting the content type as such.
